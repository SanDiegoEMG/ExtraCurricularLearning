JavaScript basic

1. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  Go to the editor
Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday. 
Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38
    1 hour
    Applied CSS styling, worked through translating the day of week (provided as number) to the actual day of the week using an array index, created reset function and button
    Yikes! Coulda done better :-(   https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercise-1.php  

2. Write a JavaScript program to print the contents of the current window.
    10 minutes
    Google-foo led directly to an answer that is a built in js method window.print()
    Still have questions about what 'window' is and how to customize this command

3. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.  Expected Output : mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy
