JavaScript basic

1. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  Go to the editor
Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday. 
Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38
    1 hour
    Applied CSS styling, worked through translating the day of week (provided as number) to the actual day of the week using an array index, created reset function and button using .empty()
    
    Yikes! Coulda done better :-(   https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercise-1.php  

2. Write a JavaScript program to print the contents of the current window.
    10 minutes
    Google-foo led directly to an answer that is a built in js method window.print()
    Still have questions about what 'window' is and how to customize this command

3. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.  Expected Output : mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy
    15 minutes - this one was straight forward but I played with layout a bit

4. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7. 
    Phew! That took over an hour for something that seemed straightforward
        used Number() on inputs in order to do calculations with them
        Oh yeah, set a form so ppl can enter their own numbers - added a reset button and an if conditional so if the numbers don't produce a valid triangle, they get a message instead of a 0 or NaN

5. Write a JavaScript program to rotate the string 'w3resource' in right direction by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.!!!!! 
    I misread this and used an input field with a rearrange button to take the first letter and move it last.
    Learned about .join("") for arrays
    Split this over 2 days with other learning

[6. Write a JavaScript program to determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.  

[7. Write a JavaScript program to find 1st January is being a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.
    Calendar stuff doesn't interest me too much

8. Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched". 
    I think we did this on an early day in class ....
    Decently happy with the functioning .... WISH THE FUNCTION WOULD STOP ACCEPTING KEYBOARD INPUT AFTER 1 ACCEPTABLE ENTRY ...

RESTCountries API
    This went quicker than I expected ... really only had a hitch with figuring out how to get to the '0' that is a layer in the return....ends up [] worked beautifully
    Not much styling work bc I ran out of time, but js function is there!
